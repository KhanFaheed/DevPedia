query_set=ModelName.objects.Methods()
 Methods----all()->returns the entire queryset, get()--->returns an object ,filter()-->returns a query set, exclude-->returns query set

 Retrieving Objects:

all(): Returns all objects in the queryset. Usually the starting point for refining a query.
get(): Returns exactly one object. Raises ModelName.DoesNotExist if no object is found, or ModelName.MultipleObjectsReturned if more than one object is found. Use with caution!
filter(**kwargs): Returns a new queryset containing objects that match the given lookup conditions. This is the workhorse of querying.
exclude(**kwargs): Returns a new queryset containing objects that do not match the given lookup conditions.
first(): Returns the first object in the queryset, or None if the queryset is empty. Useful when you expect only one result or want to avoid exceptions.
last(): Returns the last object in the queryset, or None if the queryset is empty.
count(): Returns the number of objects in the queryset. Efficiently performed by the database.
exists(): Returns True if the queryset contains any objects, False otherwise. More efficient than count() > 0.
